## Mill City Roasters

### Blower Mount

On the roasters, behind the drum is a blower that pushes the exhaust out of the drum and up into the ventilation system. The blower is typically routed to a chaff can directly behind the roaster as can be seen in the diagram represented by the red vent. In this case however, due to space constraints, a customer needed to have their chaff collector be on the side of the roaster rather than behind.

In January 2023 I decided that I would buy a car in the spring and go to Iowa to live with my grandparents and work with my uncle on the family farm. I’d always heard stories about my grandparents, great grandparents, and my dad. Stories about how hard life is on the farm, and how unrelenting the work is. I was raised to hold hard work in high regard and being the first generation on my dad’s side not brought up on the farm, I’ve wondered if I had what it took to live that life. So, I decided to find out. 

May 2023, I purchased a manual 1992 Volkswagen Cabriolet that I didn’t really know how to drive and that broke the day I bought it. After fixing and driving it home to the Twin Cities I left for Iowa to start my summer. In Iowa I worked with my uncle building houses during the day as a carpenter, and at nights and on the weekends he, my grandpa, and I tended to the farm and worked odd jobs. 
As a carpenter I worked with a crew of 4-6 people throughout the summer that would often change depending on who needed to cut or rake hay. Over the course of the summer we built a large, single family home, doing all the structural building as well as most of the finish carpentry.
