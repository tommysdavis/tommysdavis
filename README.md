## Mill City Roasters

### Blower Mount

On the roasters, behind the drum is a blower that pushes the exhaust out of the drum and up into the ventilation system. The blower is typically routed to a chaff can directly behind the roaster as can be seen in the diagram represented by the red vent. In this case however, due to space constraints, a customer needed to have their chaff collector be on the side of the roaster rather than behind. To do acheive this it was decided that the blower should be rotated 135 degrees counter clockwise.
